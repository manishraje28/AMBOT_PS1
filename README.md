# 🎓 Alumni–Student Mentorship & Opportunity Portal

## 📌 Problem Statement
Most educational institutions lack a structured digital platform to connect current students with alumni.  
Existing interactions are usually informal, untracked, and accessible only to a limited group of students.

As a result:
- Students miss out on proper mentorship and career guidance
- Internship and project opportunities are not centrally shared
- Alumni engagement with institutions remains low
- Scheduling mentorship sessions is manual and inefficient

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project introduces a **centralized Alumni–Student Mentorship & Opportunity Portal** that enables structured mentorship, real‑time communication, and automated scheduling.

The platform connects students and alumni based on **skills, domains, and interests**, allowing meaningful and scalable engagement.
